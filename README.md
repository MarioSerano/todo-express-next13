# Todo Express Next13

The goal of this repository is to learn more about Next.js 13 features alongside to develop new app, a simple Todo App.

App Router is currently experimental and taking a lot of controversy from the frontend community, so I will use that separately later.

This project uses separate frontend and backend. I was considering using [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and I was digging into it, but was dissatisfied due to it having so many abstractions and doesn't really work for learning. I create this repository strictly for learning basics of new Next 13 features and refresh some Express knowledge.

After I have explored everything, I will try to make table of contents of the things that I have learned in this project.
